# Swift: Missing Parameter Labels in Function Calls

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include parameter labels when calling a function.  The compiler will catch this error, but it can be a frustrating debugging experience if you're not careful. 

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect code, and the `bugSolution.swift` shows the corrected version.
